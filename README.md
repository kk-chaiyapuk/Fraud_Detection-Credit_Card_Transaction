# Report - Fraud Detection Algorithm - Credit Card Transaction

(There is no dataset provided. I only uploaded the code I used as well as the result.)

## Executive summary
We utilized credit card transaction data from 2010 to create a credit card transaction fraud detection model that incorporated data from both credit card companies and merchants. Through out-of-time validation, we determined that the optimal threshold for fraud detection is a score cutoff of 4% of the total population. By adopting this threshold, we expect to achieve an estimated overall savings of $20,148,000, which considers the costs and benefits of fraud detection. Specifically, we anticipate a gain of $400 for every instance of fraud successfully detected, as well as a loss of $20 for each false positive.
