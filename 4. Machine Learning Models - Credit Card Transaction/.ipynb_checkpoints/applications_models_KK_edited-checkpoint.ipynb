    "This notebook uses a wide variety of modeling algorithms for a binary classification problem. It reads a file created from a feature selection process that has a reasonably small number of good variables, and we know their order of multivariate importance because we used a proper wrapper method. We can explore # input variables, model algorithms and tune model hyperparameters. At the end we can select our favorite algorithm, run it again and build the final model performace score percentile tables.\n",
